# Reverse Integer ðŸŒ€

## Problem Description
The task is to reverse the digits of a 32-bit signed integer.

- Input: an integer `x`.
- Output: the reversed digits of `x`.
- Constraint: if the reversed value goes outside the 32-bit signed integer range  
  `[-2,147,483,648, 2,147,483,647]`, return `0` instead.

Examples:
- `123 â†’ 321`
- `-123 â†’ -321`
- `120 â†’ 21`
- `1534236469 â†’ 0` (overflow)

## Self Feedback ðŸ’¡

Solving this problem was a journey of debugging and optimization.  
At first, I struggled with overflow cases (`1534236469`, `-2147483648`) and the precision issues of `pow()`.  
By switching to an integer-only power function, adding early overflow checks, and handling negatives carefully, I finally built a **robust solution**.  

Seeing the result â€” **100% time and 71.5% space** â€” felt rewarding.  
It showed me how important it is to consider edge cases and to think about both **performance** and **correctness**.  
Next step: Iâ€™ll explore how to reduce space complexity closer to O(1) while keeping the same speed.
